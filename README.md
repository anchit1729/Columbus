# Columbus
A web app personal project that allows users to plan itineraries and offers intelligent suggestions to make trip planning easier


## Concept

The idea behind Columbus is to provide users with a uniform dashboard + toolkit that allows them to consolidate travel-related data for more efficient trip planning. Moreover, users can provide details of their stay/commute location, and Columbus will try to provide suggestions as to where they can stop along the way, points of interest they may encounter en route, etc.
